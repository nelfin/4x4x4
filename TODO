Little issues list to keep track of.. something..

ANYONE
-- Use the issue tracker, maybe?
-- Make the visualiser / worker repeatedly read and write on a loop, so we can routinely ask and receive for game states
-- Actually add some AI maybe...

EVERYONE
-- Decide on a game state format (3D array probably sufficient...)

TIM
-- Write some state functions (requires format decision)
   -- [state] get_successors(state, player)
   -- player  check_victory(state)
DONE-- Test out git (if you can see this, this is done) 

JOSH
-- You too
-- Add Deets to README _/ (that's a tick)  (better tick)

ANDREW
-- Chill out
DONE-- Add Deets to README

TIM AND JOSH
-- Merge visualisation code
